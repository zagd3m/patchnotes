# Todo List Before Adding Content

## Essential Tasks

1. **Create Sample Patch Section Files**
   - Create 3 placeholder markdown files in `_includes/patch-sections/` for:
     - Classes Changes
     - Items Changes
     - Systems Changes

2. **Create Individual Section Pages**
   - Set up the section pages in `docs/sections/` that will include the relevant patch section content:
     - classes.md
     - items.md
     - systems.md

3. **Set Up the Full Notes Page**
   - Update `full-notes.md` to include all section content files

4. **Update the Index Page**
   - Add content to `index.md` explaining what the site is about

5. **Test the Navigation**
   - Ensure dropdown menus work correctly
   - Verify links between pages

## Optional Enhancements (if needed)

1. **Update Config File**
   - Review and update `_config.yml` settings if needed

2. **Add Favicon**
   - Create a simple favicon for the site

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Ensure the navigation works well on mobile devices

4. **Add GitHub Edit Links**
   - Add links to allow direct editing of content on GitHub (if desired)

**Note:** Keep everything as minimalist as possible while still being functional. Focus on getting the core structure in place before adding actual content.
