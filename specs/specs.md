# Specifications for this project

This file was written by a human.
This file should not be visible on the website.

The website is https://zagd3m.github.io/patchnotes/
It is hosted on GitHub Pages.
It is written in Jekyll.
All content is markdown based.

The website should have:
- A readme or about or index with the main page, explaining what this is about
- A full page with the whole patch notes
- A set of pages for each part of the patch notes, to be read separately
- A navigation bar to navigate between the pages

The content of the full patch notes and the content of the pages for each part of the patch notes should be the same - modifying a part would modify the full patch notes, since it is simply a concatenation of the parts.

Anything used here should be compatible with Github Pages.
