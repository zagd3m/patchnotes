# Jekyll Implementation Guide for Patch Notes Website

This report provides a comprehensive exploration of existing Jekyll projects and implementation strategies to help you create your patch notes website according to your specifications. The focus is on simple, standard approaches that facilitate content reuse across individual pages and a full consolidated view.

## Overview of Requirements

Your patch notes website requires a structure that allows patch note content to be maintained in a modular way while being displayed both as individual sections and as a consolidated whole. The key technical challenge is implementing content reusability while maintaining a clean, navigable structure with the minimal theme on GitHub Pages.

## Basic Jekyll Setup and Structure

### Starting with a Minimal Setup

The "Simplest Jekyll" project by Michael Currin provides an excellent baseline for understanding the minimal requirements for a Jekyll site on GitHub Pages:

```
- index.md (homepage)
- _config.yml (theme and configuration)
- Gemfile (optional, for local development)
```

This structure demonstrates how little you need to get started with a Jekyll site[^1]. For your project, you'll expand this slightly to accommodate the patch notes sections.

### Recommended File Structure

Based on your requirements, an optimal file structure would be:

```
/patchnotes/
  ├── _config.yml
  ├── index.md (About/README)
  ├── full-notes.md (Complete patch notes)
  ├── _data/
  │   └── navigation.yml
  ├── _includes/
  │   ├── patch-sections/
  │   │   ├── section1.md
  │   │   ├── section2.md
  │   │   └── section3.md
  │   └── navigation.html
  └── sections/
      ├── section1.md
      ├── section2.md
      └── section3.md
```


## Navigation System Implementation

For the navigation bar, you can implement a solution similar to the one described in the Jekyll NavBar gist. The key steps are:

1. Create a `_data/navigation.yml` file listing all your pages:
```yaml
- title: Home
  url: /patchnotes/

- title: Full Patch Notes
  url: /patchnotes/full-notes/

- title: Sections
  url: /patchnotes/sections/
  sublinks:
    - title: Section 1
      url: /patchnotes/sections/section1/
    - title: Section 2
      url: /patchnotes/sections/section2/
```

2. Create an `_includes/navigation.html` file that builds the navigation bar and highlights the current page[^3].

This approach automatically creates a navigation bar with dropdown functionality and current page highlighting. The Jekyll NavBar system includes code that identifies the current page and applies appropriate styling[^3].

## Content Reusability Strategies

### Approach 1: Using Jekyll Includes

The simplest approach to sharing content between the individual section pages and the full patch notes page is to use Jekyll includes. Here's how:

1. Store each patch notes section as a separate markdown file in `_includes/patch-sections/`.
2. Include these files in both the individual section pages and the full patch notes page.

For the full patch notes page (`full-notes.md`):

```markdown
---
layout: default
title: Full Patch Notes
---

# Complete Patch Notes

{% include patch-sections/section1.md %}
{% include patch-sections/section2.md %}
{% include patch-sections/section3.md %}
```

For individual section pages (e.g., `sections/section1.md`):

```markdown
---
layout: default
title: Section 1
---

# Section 1

{% include patch-sections/section1.md %}
```

This approach is straightforward and doesn't require any plugins[^5][^6].

### Approach 2: Using Front Matter for Content Sharing

This part was removed because Approach 1 was preferred.

## Implementation Examples from Existing Projects

### Simplest Jekyll

The "Simplest Jekyll" project demonstrates the minimal setup required for a Jekyll site on GitHub Pages. It uses just a single content page (`index.md`), a configuration file (`_config.yml`), and an optional Gemfile for local development[^1].

This project shows how easy it is to get started with Jekyll, making it a good reference for beginners.

### Simply Jekyll

While more feature-rich than your requirements, Simply Jekyll provides insights into content organization. It supports wiki-style linking between pages, which could be useful if your patch notes require cross-referencing[^2].

### Unidata Jekyll Theme

This project demonstrates a custom approach to content sharing using a plugin that allows you to include content from separate markdown files:

```markdown
{% includefiles pages/unidata/sharing_content.md %}
```

This approach keeps the shared content in standalone files without frontmatter, making it easier to maintain and reuse across multiple pages[^7].

## Recommended Implementation Approach

Based on the analysis of existing projects and your specific requirements, I recommend the following implementation:

1. **Use Jekyll Includes for Content Sharing**: Store patch note sections as individual markdown files in `_includes/patch-sections/` and include them in both individual pages and the full notes page.
2. **Create a Navigation Data File**: Use a `_data/navigation.yml` file to define your navigation structure.
3. **Implement a Navigation Bar Template**: Create an `_includes/navigation.html` file based on the Jekyll NavBar example.
4. **Keep the Theme Minimal**: Configure the minimal theme in your `_config.yml` file
5. **Setup Individual Section Pages**: Create markdown files for each section that include the relevant content file.
6. **Create the Full Notes Page**: Make a single page that includes all section content files in sequence.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

1. **Initialize Your Jekyll Site**:
    - Create a new repository or use your existing one
    - Add the basic Jekyll configuration files
2. **Configure the Minimal Theme**:
    - Update `_config.yml` to use the minimal theme
3. **Create Content Structure**:
    - Make an `_includes/patch-sections/` directory
    - Create markdown files for each patch note section
    - Create individual page files that include these sections
    - Create a full notes page that includes all sections
4. **Implement Navigation**:
    - Create `_data/navigation.yml` with your site structure
    - Add `_includes/navigation.html` to build the navigation bar
    - Include the navigation in your layout or pages
5. **Test Locally** (optional):
    - Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to test your site
    - Verify that navigation works and content appears correctly
6. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
    - Push your changes to GitHub
    - Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled for your repository

## Conclusion

By leveraging Jekyll's include system and creating a structured organization for your patch notes content, you can achieve a maintainable website that meets all your requirements. The approaches outlined here prioritize simplicity and standard Jekyll features, avoiding unnecessary complexity while still delivering a functional, user-friendly patch notes system.

The key to success is the separation of content (patch notes sections) from presentation (individual pages and full view), allowing you to maintain your content in one place while displaying it in multiple contexts. This structure ensures that updates to any section automatically propagate to both the individual page and the full patch notes view.
