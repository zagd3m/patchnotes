Charges are "shared" between charge-up attacks so the first attack will apply a stage 1 effect and generate 1 charge, the second attack will apply a stage 2 effect and generate 1-2 charges, and the third attack will apply a stage 3 effect before the charges are reset and the cycle repeats.<br>  - Since charges are reset after the 3rd attack rather than before the first attack of the next cycle, it's impossible to have 3 charges of any single type; to get 3 charges, they must be of different types. A finishing move can be used at any point to consume the charges as usual.<br>- ?<br>**Season 1:**<br>- attack rating bonus increased<br>**[Vanilla Info](https://www.theamazonbasin.com/wiki/index.php?title=Tiger_Strike)** |

Charges are "shared" between charge-up attacks so the first attack will apply a stage 1 effect and generate 1 charge, the second attack will apply a stage 2 effect and generate 1-2 charges, and the third attack will apply a stage 3 effect before the charges are reset and the cycle repeats.<br>  - Since charges are reset after the 3rd attack rather than before the first attack of the next cycle, it's impossible to have 3 charges of any single type; to get 3 charges, they must be of different types. A finishing move can be used at any point to consume the charges as usual.<br>- synergy increased from 10% to 16%<br>- ?<br>**Season 1:**<br>- attack rating bonus increased<br>- synergy is now 10% (was 8%)<br>**[Vanilla Info](https://www.theamazonbasin.com/wiki/index.php?title=Claws_of_Thunder)** |

Whirlwind hits once every 5 frames when using a single weapon or twice every 6 frames when dual-wielding

For dual-wielding Whirlwind, the first 5 frame check will attack with the primary weapon, and every 5 frames afterward the weapon used to attack will alternate, as a result of the "one target per attack" change. This indicates that dual-wielding Whirlwind will have large redundancy, as you can only ever attack with one weapon at a time.<br>- Enhanced Damage bonus at Level 1 reduced from +50% to +25%<br>- Enhanced Damage bonus per level has reduced from +6% to +4%<br>**Season 1:**<br>- moved in the skill tree<br>- prerequisites reduced from 5 to 3 (no longer requires Bash, Stun, Leap, Leap Attack, now requires Frenzy, Berserk)<br>- Movement speed increased by character's FRW speed<br>- Now also scales velocity at 4% per level<br>- bonus attack rating now starts at 240% (was 0%)<br>- damage bonus increased to 50% + 6% per level (was -50% + 8%)<br>- Will not apply splash damage from melee weapons<br>**[Vanilla Info](https://www.theamazonbasin.com/wiki/index.php?title=Whirlwind)** |

Radius: 10 yards

Your attacks (including spells) ignore physical resistance of undead enemies other than "prime evils" (act bosses, map bosses, ubers) even if they are immune - your damage is applied to them as if they had 0% physical resistance. Note: Only applies to the supplier's physical damage and not to that of allies; this effect also applies to undead targets beyond its radius.

Resistances are reduced at 1/2 effectiveness when those resistances are above 99% (immunes) or below 0%

| **Season 9:**<br>- Changed Holy Sword to have no internal animation timer (i.e. 0 frame block), this means "faster block rate" has no effect.<br>**Season 8:**<br>- Replaced Conversion with a new skill: Holy Sword<br>  - Allows the paladin to gain parry chance while wielding two handed swords (Similar to Weapon Block)<br>  - Just like Weapon Block, parry works while moving<br>  - There is a 4 frame delay (or 0.16 seconds) between two potentially successful parries.<br>  - Provides the paladin with increased damage to demons and undead<br>  - Fixed the parry bonus from block being 10:1 block to parry chance to 5:1 block to parry chance _(patch 2)_ |
