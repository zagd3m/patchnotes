## About

I am Zagd3m. I've been playing D2 since WW1, and before that I was serving in a pre-life bacteria research facility on mars. I said too much. I tend to spam the #feedback channel with ideas, so I made a website to collect them. Simpler, leaner, nerdier. 

Good game design often involves finding the right balance between competing goals and understanding that not every player will agree with every decision. That's why some suggestions have been [censored](/patchnotes/censored). With that said, see you on Discord's #feedback channel.
