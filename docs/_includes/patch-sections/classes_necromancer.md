## Necromancer

### Iron Golem {#iron-golem}

> Free auras are power creep. Nonsense !

- Iron golems are no longer cast on items, but instead summoned normally (as other summons)
- Iron golems are destroyed when your mercenary's item is changed or removed
- Iron golems use your Mercenary's weapon
- You can now have 5 iron golems, just like any other golem

This makes IG pretty appealing for necros and other classes, without providing an additional aura. Feel free to use them with Doom or Infinity though. It might also be nice to pair IGs with other golems.

### Bone Armor

> Spells shouldn't be better when you invest no points in them but only synergies.

Base absorb per point increased to **15 to 20** (slowly increasing).

Synergies changed:

- Gains +3 Additional Absorb per Energy
- Bone Wall: ~~+15~~ **10** Damage Absorbed per Level
- Bone Prison: ~~+15~~ **10** Damage Absorbed per Level

### Bone Spirit

> Almost never used for mapping

- Bone Spirit now explodes into a Bone Nova on impact.

This should give it some AoE.
