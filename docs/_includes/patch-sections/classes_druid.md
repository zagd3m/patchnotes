## Druid

### Skills

#### Raven

> Raven should be a "main skill", which means one should be able to play a Raven Druid, centered on this skill. For this to happen, we need it to have specific synergies that make it diverge from the "all summons" druid that we're used to (with wolves and grizzlies). I specifically intended to make the Raven Druid squishier than the summon druid, by removing most of its mean shield, but I kept the Spirit Wolf to keep the summoner feel and to give it some level of tankyness.

Synergies changed :

- Summon Spirit Wolf: ~~+12%~~ **+3%** Damage per Level
- ~~Summon Dire Wolf: +12% Damage per Level~~
- ~~Summon Grizzly: +12% Damage per Level~~
- **Hurricane: +3% Damage per Level**
- **Carrion Vine: +3% Damage per Level**

The base damage has been increased to compendate (see [Synergies changes](/patchnotes/sections/systems)) for the synergies % being nerfed.

#### Hurricane

These changes aim to make Hurricane more impactful when fully synergized, while maintaining its power as a secondary source of damage.

Synergies changed :

- ~~Arctic Blast: +12% Damage per Level~~
- Tornado: ~~+12%~~ **+3%** Damage per Level
- **Raven: +3% Damage per Level**
- **Shock Wave: +3% Damage per Level**

The base damage has been increased to compendate (see [Synergies changes](/patchnotes/sections/systems)) for the synergies % being nerfed, and, additionnally, the max damage (fully synergized) has been increased by 150%.
