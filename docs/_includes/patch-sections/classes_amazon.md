### Guided Arrow

> Guided Arrow isn't used at all. Let's rework it.

- Now shoots additional projectiles (magic arrow scaling, from 1 to 5)
- Projectiles from the same volley can't hit the same target (each has its own target, or vanishes)
- Does not shotgun

This would let players use Guided Arrow as a damage skill, a bit like Multiple Shot.
