## Bosses and end-game content

Bosses (Ubers, Dclone, Lucion, Rathma, ...) are great end-game content. But they come with 3 major issues:

- First, new players are scared to try them and lose the currencies involved, making end game content a thing for veterans who specialize in this.
- Second, the whole game is slowly getting balanced around those, which is detrimental for build diversity in the rest of the game, which is what most players care about.
- The skills involved in defeating the bosses are : rejuv timing, boss knowledge, and gear. The last ones are fine, but rejuv timing isn't health as a key skill.

### How to get players to try end game bosses ?

Currencies involved in looting an end game boss shouldn't be consumed when opening its map, but when transforming its "head" (a trophy gained upon killing it/him/her) into actual items (being torches, annis, ...). This change would let players try those fights as much as they want, without fearing to losing anythings (but xp and gold, at least in SC). This **wouldn't change anything** for veterans who succeed 99% of the time anyways.

*Note : we might consider implementing something that prevents trophies / heads from being traded.*

### How to balance the game without focusing on bosses ?

Take Hydras for example. They were nerfed because bossing with them was popular, but in maps they suck. At the moment, we can't buff them without them being OP against bosses. Result : one skill is gone for most players.

The solution would be to have specific balance numbers for skills in the context of bosses, just like we do for PvP. Basically, we could say Hydras deal 50% less damage in boo maps, thus separating their effectiveness for Lod/Mapping from their ability to defeat, say, Dclone.

### How to get late game fights to be more than just rejuv timing ?

- Remove total rejuvs from the game (too strong, even in maps, and detrimental to defensive gear balance).
- When a player enters a boss map, the potions that were in its inventory (not in its belt) are dropped in front of the portal (in town) before getting into it (so we have less potions, total).

This means boss fights will involve up to 4 times 4 potions, which can be 33% rajuvs or regular potions.

Obviously this means rebalancing those fights, but it will make them more interesting. We can even do only one of the bosses for season 11 (to see how people adapt), and then roll the others in s12 with the adjustments needed.
