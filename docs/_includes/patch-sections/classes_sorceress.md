## Sorceress

### Cold Enchant

> Using Cold + Fire enchant should be an option.

- Chilling Armor synergy removed
- Warmth synergy added

### Inferno (QoL)

> Inferno's width is a bit thin close to the sorc. Missing enemies in melee range is pretty common.

- Moved the cone back a little bit to gain some initial width, as if the spell was cast slightly behind the sorc.

---

> Sorceress spells have more synergies than needed, since they also require Element Mastery. Let's clean this a bit.

### Ice Blast

- Ice Bolt synergy nerfed to +2% damage per level
- Other synergy unchanged
- Base damage buffed to compensate

### Glacial Spike

- Ice Bolt synergy nerfed to +2% damage per level
- Other synergy unchanged
- Base damage buffed to compensate

### Ice Barrage

- Glacial Spike synergy nerfed to +2% damage per level
- Other synergy unchanged
- Base damage buffed to compensate

### Frozen Orb

- Synergies nerfed from +4% to +2% damage per level (D2 LoD value)
- Base damage buffed to compensate

### Lightning (patch option 1)

- Charged bolt synergy removed
- Chain Lightning synergy increased from 6% to 10%

This should give Lightning an identity as a level spell and/or a hybrid build spell.

### Lightning (patch option 2)

- Charged bolt synergy replaced by Thunder Storm

This would make Lightning / TS a viable build, and a clearly distinct build compared to Chain Lightning.

### Thunder Storm

- Now shoots 4x more often
- Damage reduced to compensate

### Blaze

- Duration increased from 3-10 seconds to Energy Shield's duration

### Fire Ball

- Fire Bolt synergy nerfed to +5% damage per level
- Combustion synergy removed
- Base damage buffed to compensate
- Damage scaling changed, to make the spell around levels 15-25, catching up later, so that leveling with FB doesn't become a problem

This should help Fire Ball be the leveling spell and/or secondary spell it wants to be.

### Lesser Hydra

- Projectiles now pierce through enemies.

This should help Hydras work as a Mapping spell, not only as a boss fight one.
