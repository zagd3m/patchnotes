# Systems Changes

This file will contain the patch notes for system changes in Project Diablo 2.

## Simplifying the game

Pillar #4 of Zagd3m's patch notes is noob friendlyness. And you know what isn't ? Things that are complex for no reason at all.

Examples :

- skills that don't benefit from %enhanced damage against demons
- mods that don't do what they say (ex : %ed/max jewels before the bugfix)
- bonuses that look good on paper but are not useful in practice (ex: IAS on a skill that doesn't benefit from IAS)

So let's fix this.
