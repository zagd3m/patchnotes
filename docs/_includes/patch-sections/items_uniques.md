### Throwing

#### Warshrike

Warshrike can take a buff now that the A3 mercs can't abuse it anymore.

### Maces

#### Demon Limb

Demon limb should not be a prebuff item, but an actual elite weapon.

### Wands

#### Boneshade

Unique items shouldn't be golden rare items. They need something the rares don't have. This design keeps the purpose and theme of the item without being identical to a good rare for the slot.

| Before (current PD2)                            | After                                          |

### Shields

#### Moser's Blessed Circle

Moser's Blessed Circle is a powerful defensive option that could benefit from scaling with character progression.
This change maintains its mid-game power while making it a bit more appealing later into the game, and keeping the identity of a "resists" item.

| Before (based on PD2 wiki)                      | After                                          |

### Scepters

#### Heaven's Light

Heaven's Light should live up to its name with lightning and holy-themed effects.

| Before (based on PD2 wiki)                      | After                                          |

### Belts

#### Gloom's Trap

This belt focuses on mana utility but lacks defensive capabilities against casters.
The "gloom" word reminds me of the Gloom runeword so I decided to add a (weaker) Dim Vision when struck effect too.

| Before (based on PD2 wiki)                      | After                                          |

### Amulets

#### Nokozan Relic

The relic's fire damage should scale with character progression to remain relevant.
I wish this was an option for Vengeance paladins so the item doesn't simply exist as a "shit that amy again" moment.

| Before (based on PD2 wiki)                      | After                                          |

#### Eye of Etlich

This amulet's cold damage is too minimal at higher levels and should scale with character progression.

| Before (based on PD2 wiki)                      | After                                          |

#### Saracen's Chance

Iron Maiden is rarely useful for most builds. Replacing it with Attack Rating or Magic Find would make this amulet more versatile, while adding a bit or r&d for late ladder optimization.

| Before (based on PD2 wiki)                      | After                                          |

| -                                               | **+[75-100] to Attack Rating**                 |

#### The Rising Sun

Moving Meteor procs to on-striking or on-casting would make this amulet more reliable for casters.

| Before (based on PD2 wiki)                      | After                                          |
