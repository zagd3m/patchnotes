## Tradesite

A good tradesite is key to a good economy, and a fluid experience, even for non veterans.

### Pricing

Pricing is a huge issue. People keep writing "offer" because (1) they are lazy or more often because (2) they don't know how to price stuff.
The tradesite should automatically suggest a price for the items listed.

To the team : if you think this is hard to code, ask, I offered to help with this 2years ago and I'm still willing to. I appear to work in this field so I'm pretty confident this can be done without much effort.

### Keyboard

Non-US persons sometimes struggle with copy-pasting stuff for keyboard reasons. Fix this please.

### Timezones

Timezones aren't easy to deal with. Being able to enter a basic "time where I can be there" thing and filter sellers based on potential availability would be helpful.
Thos who don't want to use that can very well not use the filter.
