### Skills

#### Frenzy

> Frenzy is mostly used as a passive that you have to "charge up" from time to time. We decided to turn it into an active skill. With those changes, Frenzy is still worth investing points on for non-frenzy builds needing AS/MS, and is now more rewarding as an active skill.

- Frenzy bonuses are lost upon using any other skill.
- Hard points no longer increase duration, which is fixed at 25 seconds (max).
- Frenzy now has a passive component : "After killing an enemy, gain AS and MS based on hard points (from 1 AS / 20 MS to 40 AS / 60 MS)."
- Frenzy base numbers have been changed to incorporate this passive (meaning the skill grants less AR/MS, but it is compensated).

#### Find Potion and Find Item

> Find Potion and Find Item have been reworked. They were a good idea on paper but it never really clicked because of the [boring dilemma](gamedesign#boring-dilemmas).

- Gobble Potion is now a passive that grants temporary movement speed for 5 seconds after drinking any potion
- Find Item is now a passive that grants passive gold find and magic find (small amounts) per soft and hard points
