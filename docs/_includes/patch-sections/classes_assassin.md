## Assassin

### Skills

#### Tiger Strike

Tiger Strike should not be an auxiliary skill for Blade Dance.

- Tiger Strike bonuses are lost upon using Blade Dance.
- Tiger Strike radius has been buffed from 0/20/40 to 20/40/60.

Overall this makes Tiger Strike more appealing for mapping, without indirectly buffing WWsins.

#### Dragon Talon

Dragon Talon is the poor man's Dragon Tail. With this change, we make is a 1-synergy skill so it can be played without DTail.

Synergies changed :

- ~~Dragon Tail: +22% Damage per Level~~
- Dragon Flight: +5% Damage per Level

The base damage has been increased to compendate (see [Synergies changes](/patchnotes/sections/systems)) for the synergies % being nerfed, resulting in equivalent damage.
