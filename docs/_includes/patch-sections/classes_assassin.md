## Assassin

### Skills

#### Tiger Strike

> Tiger Strike should not be an auxiliary skill for Blade Dance. Overall this makes Tiger Strike more appealing for mapping, without indirectly buffing WWsins.

- Tiger Strike bonuses are lost upon using Blade Dance.
- Tiger Strike radius has been buffed from 0/20/40 to 20/40/60.

#### Dragon Talon

> Dragon Talon is the poor man's Dragon Tail. With this change, we make is a 1-synergy skill so it can be played without DTail.

Synergies changed :

- ~~Dragon Tail: +22% Damage per Level~~
- Dragon Flight: +5% Damage per Level

The base damage has been increased to compendate (see [Synergies changes](/patchnotes/sections/systems)) for the synergies % being nerfed, resulting in equivalent damage.

#### Dragon Claw

> Dragon Claw is a good skill, but its breakpoints are confusing. Let's make it more noob friendly.

Changed the attack speed formula to make Dragon Claw easier to understand:

- Now uses the standard attack speed formula (just like Tiger Strike for example)
- The second strike always occurs 4 frames after the first hit

This means that a 6fpa build would do both hits in 10 frames. Simple. Clear. Nothing substantial lost in the process.

#### Dragon Flight {#dragon-flight}

> Dflight is great, but too strong as a 1-pt wonder, and too reliant on Stalker's cull.

- Cooldown: ~~2~~ **2.5** seconds
- **Hard points now reduce the cooldown by .1 seconds (reaching .5 second at 20 points)**
- **There is no item in the game** reducing the cooldown of DFlight [anymore](full-notes#stalker).

#### Wake of Inferno

> Make it viable for mapping.

AoE strongly increased, both in width and in length, to make the skill viable for mapping.

Synergies changed:

- ~~Fire Blast: +10% Fire Damage per Level~~
- Wake of Fire: ~~+10%~~ **+3% Fire Damage per Level**
- **Death Sentry: +3% Damage per Level**

The base damage has been increased to compendate (see [Synergies changes](/patchnotes/sections/systems)) for the synergies % being nerfed, resulting in equivalent damage.

#### Death Sentry

> Death Sentry shouldn't be a one point wonder, or even a 20 point skill, since it would be too strong. High percent synergies seem reasonable in this case.

Synergies changed:

- ~~Wake of Fire: +8% Fire Damage per Level~~
- ~~Fire Blast: +8% Fire Damage per Level~~
- Charged Bolt Sentry: +8% Damage per Level
- Wake of Inferno: +8% Damage per Level

The goal here is to make DS a dedicated build, where players use it as a main skill, so we put weird synergies to avoid making it a fire or light spell. Also, we didn't pick the same synergies as WoI, so that WoI players have to choose if they want to add 20 extra points into CBS for more DS damage. I think this is meaningful choice, with both pure WoI and pure DS and hybrid builds being viable.
