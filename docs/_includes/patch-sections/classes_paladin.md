## Paladin

### Skills - Defensive auras

#### Prayer

> We want to make Prayer more appealing as a defensive aura, and to encourage Paladins to try builds leveraging flat pdr/mdr.

Now grants **magic damage reduced by** and **physical damage reduced by** to the user (not to the party).

Rough values would be like :

- Level 1 : 1
- Level 20 : 10
- Level 40 : 20
- Level 60 : 30

### Skills - Offensive auras

#### Concentration

> Concentration has two main issues : (1) no clear identity and (2) mandatory for hammerdins. Let's fix both.

- Your Blessed Hammer Skill Damage +% **lowered** from 30-472% to 10-50%. This is already HUGE, but I can see how people could - on meme builds - use another aura and accept ~40% less damage in exchange.
- **Lowered** AR and ED, but now grants a good amount of **AR/ED against Demons**.

These changes give Concentration a cleared identity, and a role in builds that need more than raw damage.

#### Fanaticism

> Note: Fanaticism has also been impacted by the [skill IAS](#skill-ias) change, though the values have been adjusted to compensate.

#### Conviction

> Conviction is really, really strong. It breaks immunities, lowers resistances, lowers defense, and applies instantly. Like, 10x better than Lower Resist. This needs a strong rework. Here's what I suggest.

##### Option 1 - slight nerf to infinity, conviction unchanged

- Radius nerfed to 12 + 1 per hard point.

This means [Infinity](#infinity) would use a range of 12 (equivalent to Nova, sorceress spell), while a paladin with a lvl 30 conviction would hit 12 + 20 = 31, almost unchanged from current value (34). That nerf would mostly affect the Infinity item without hurting paladins.

##### Option 2 - strong rework, new identity

- Vengeance damage increased significantly
- Conviction no longer reduces resistances
- Immune monsters affected by conviction have their resistances set to 90% - 0.5 per soft point - 0.5 per hard points

This moves Conviction from "break immunities AND lower resistances" to "break immunities". It also keeps [Infinity](#infinity) as a key item for LoD, but a bit less so for maps, flattening the late game power curve a bit.

> Such a massive change would require rebalancing several skills. A short term solution could be to keep *some* form of resistance reduction, lowering it season by season until it can be removed entirely. This would make the balance team's work a lot easier.

### Skills - Combat skills

#### Zeal

> Zeal paladins need some help with mobility.

- Sacrifice synergy removed
- Joust synergy added (with the same %)

#### Joust

> We want Joust to have the opportunity to be a main skill.

Now gains +200% splash radius on the initial strike (called impale in the description), promoting builds that use Joust for its own damage.

New synergies:

- **Thorns : Cooldown reduced by .5 / 20 seconds** (note that Alma and Leoric no longer reduce the cooldown in Zagd3m's patch)
- **Vigor : Cooldown reduced by .5 / 20 seconds** (note that Alma and Leoric no longer reduce the cooldown in Zagd3m's patch)

With maxxed synergies, a .5 total cooldown is possible.

#### Blessed Hammer

> We want diversity amongst hammerdins. Blessed Hammer should be a skill that can be used with Concentration or another aura.

**Base damage buffed** (significantly) to compensate for the Concentration change and the synergy changes. Total damage (with Concentration aura) when fully synergized are identical to the current numbers.

Synergies changed :

- Blessed Aim: ~~+12%~~ **+3%** Magic Damage per Level
- Vigor: ~~+12%~~ **+3%** Magic Damage per Level
- Meditation: hammers have 5% chance (upon being cast) to be intangible, thus not being affected by walls or other objects they collide with.

Overall, Blessed Hammer can now:

- be used with Concentration to gain up to 50% damage increase (more likely 40% since 50% would be Conc level 60)
- or with another aura to gain other benefits

Players also have the choice to invest in Meditation for intangibility, or to skip it to gain the benefit of other skills (eg. Holy Shield, ...). This gives meaningful choices to Hammerdin builds, and will significantly increase the build diversity of Hammerdins.
