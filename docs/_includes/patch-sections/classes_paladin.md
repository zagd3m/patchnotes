### Skills

#### Concentration

Concentration has two main issues : (1) no clear identity and (2) mandatory for hammerdins. Let's fix both.

- Your Blessed Hammer Skill Damage +% **lowered** from 30-472% to 10-50%. This is already huge, but I can see how people could use another aura and accept ~40% less damage in exchange.
- **Lowered** AR and ED, but now grants a good amount of **AR/ED against Demons**.

These changes give Concentration a cleared identity, and a role in builds that need more than raw damage.

#### Joust

Now gains +200% splash radius on the initial strike (called impale in the description), promoting builds that use Joust for its own damage.

New synergies:

- **Thorns : Cooldown reduced by .5 / 20 seconds** (note that Alma and Leoric no longer reduce the cooldown in Zagd3m's patch)
- **Vigor : Cooldown reduced by .5 / 20 seconds** (note that Alma and Leoric no longer reduce the cooldown in Zagd3m's patch)

With maxxed synergies, a .5 total cooldown is possible.

#### Blessed Hammer

**Base damage buffed** (significantly) to compensate for the Concentration change and the synergy changes. Total damage (with Concentration aura) when fully synergized are identical to the current numbers.

Synergies changed :

- Blessed Aim: ~~+12%~~ **+3%** Magic Damage per Level
- Vigor: ~~+12%~~ **+3%** Magic Damage per Level
- Meditation: hammers have 5% chance (upon being cast) to be intangible, thus not being affected by walls or other objects they collide with.

Overall, Blessed Hammer can now:

- be used with Concentration to gain up to 50% damage increase (more likely 40% since 50% would be Conc level 60)
- or with another aura to gain other benefits

Players also have the choice to invest in Meditation for intangibility, or to skip it to gain the benefit of other skills (eg. Holy Shield, ...). This gives meaningful choices to Hammerdin builds, and will significantly increase the build diversity of Hammerdins.
