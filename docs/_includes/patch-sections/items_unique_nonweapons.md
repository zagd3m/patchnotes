## Unique items

### Shields

#### Moser's Blessed Circle

> Moser's Blessed Circle is a powerful defensive option that could benefit from scaling with character progression. This change maintains its mid-game power while making it a bit more appealing later into the game, and keeping the identity of a "resists" item.

#### Alma Negra

> CDR on Alma Negra and Leoric is limiting build diversity right now.

No longer reduces Joust cooldown.

### Helmets

#### Ravenlore

We want a Raven Druid build. See the changes to the [Raven skill](full-notes#raven) too.

### Belts

#### Gloom's Trap

> This belt focuses on mana utility but lacks defensive capabilities against casters. The "gloom" word reminds me of the Gloom runeword so I decided to add a (weaker) Dim Vision when struck effect too.

| Current PD2                      | Zagd3m's patch                                          |

### Amulets

#### Nokozan Relic

> The relic's fire damage should scale with character progression to remain relevant. I wish this was an option for Vengeance paladins so the item doesn't simply exist as a "shit that amy again" moment.

| Current PD2                      | Zagd3m's patch                                          |

#### Eye of Etlich

> This amulet's cold damage is too minimal at higher levels and should scale with character progression.

| Current PD2                      | Zagd3m's patch                                          |

| Adds [4-6] to [12-20] Cold Damage               | **Adds [1-100] to Cold Damage (+1 per Character Level)** |

#### Saracen's Chance

> Iron Maiden is rarely useful for most builds. Replacing it with Attack Rating or Magic Find would make this amulet more versatile, while adding a bit or r&d for late ladder optimization.

| Current PD2                      | Zagd3m's patch                                          |
|:--|:--|

| -                                               | **+[75-100] to Attack Rating**                 |
| -                                               | **[15-25]% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items** |

#### The Rising Sun

> Moving Meteor procs to on-striking or on-casting would make this amulet more reliable for casters.

| Current PD2                      | Zagd3m's patch                                          |
|:--|:--|

| +[1-2] to Fire Skills                           | +[1-2] to Fire Skills                          |
| Adds [80-124] to [200-248] Fire Damage          | Adds [80-124] to [200-248] Fire Damage         |
| -[4-8]% to Enemy Fire Resistance                | -[4-8]% to Enemy Fire Resistance               |
| Replenish Life +10                              | Replenish Life +10                             |

| -                                               | **10% Chance to Cast Level 25 Meteor on Striking** |
| -                                               | **15% Chance to Cast Level 35 Meteor on Casting** |
