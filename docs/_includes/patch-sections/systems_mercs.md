## Mercenaries

Mercs in d2 were too strong, and PD2 made it worse. The amount of free power, with almost any tradeoff, coming from mercs, is huge. Specifically, mercs are aurabots and cursebots which makes the game far too easy and the itemization of our characters without tradeoff.

*Note : This situation comes from the fact that many builds are crap without infinity (for ex) being involved. As a result, playing those builds alone would suck without mercs having this source of auras, and they would pretty much be limited to groups of players. I don't want to prevent people from playing their fire build solo ; but there are other solutions. Here, I'll focus on limiting the power coming from mercs, and we'll cover recovery options afterwards.*

[Iron golems](full-notes#iron-golem) will be reworked for the same reason and won't provide an aura.

### Auras

Mercs can now only have 2 auras : one from their own inner aura (ex : defiance for a2 merc), and one from an item. If several items granting an aura are equipped, only one applies, chosen based on aura level (higher first) and (if equivalent) item slot (weapon > belt > boots > gloves > helm > chest).

### Curses

Curses are unchanged, but please note that Innocence has been reworked to avoid its nonsensical power.
