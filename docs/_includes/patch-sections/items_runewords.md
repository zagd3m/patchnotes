## Runewords

> *"Imo, runewords are there for reliable, unique combinations of buffs. They should be similar to uniques in that they aren't just rare items : they must bring something specific. The difference is that you can choose the base (which should be meaningful), but you can't slam. It makes runewords more reliable, more personalized, but with less 'perfect' potential."* - Me

### Voice of Reason

*4-Socket Swords/Tipped Maces/Bows/Crossbows*  
*Lem • Ko • El • Eld*  

> This runeword needs more interesting mechanics to compete with other options. The casting / blocking part will only be useful for block casting sorcs, who don't benefit from ar/ed, helping balancing the item. Rlvl was rised due to Frozen Orb level being rised.

### Oath

*4-Socket Swords/Axes/Tipped Maces*  
*Shael • Pul • Mal • Lum*  
*Required Level: 49*

> Increasing the level of Bone Spirit on this runeword makes it more relevant for late-game and provides better damage output for players who invest in it. Note that this is exploitable using [Innocence](#innocence), but I advocated for nerfing it so I'm not balancing around this nonsensical item.

### Passion

> Passion is used as a pre-Ferocity item. Having so little AR and such a low level zeal is really gamebreaking for some builds. I think we can buff it without fear of it becoming better than end-game weapons used in combination with Ferocity. This change aims at making Passion good enough until Ferocity becomes affordable (right now people level & farm with other builds).

**4-Socket Weapons**

**Dol • Ort • Eld • Lem**

### Call To Arms

> CTA should not be a prebuff item. Prebuffing is against our principles (see Game Design section).

**5-Socket Weapons**

**Amn • Ral • Mal • Ist • Ohm**

**Required Level:** 57

| Current PD2 | Zagd3m's patch |
|:--- |:--- |
| +1 to All Skills | **+2 to All Skills** |

| +[1-3] to [Battle Cry](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Battle_Cry "Battle Cry") | **Removed** |
| Replenish Life +12 | **Removed** |
| 30% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items | **60% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items** |
| - | **10% chance to cast level 1 Battle Wrath on kill** |

**NOTE:** [Battle Orders](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Battle_Orders "Battle Orders") has been reworked and now grants a flat amount of life/mana. For example, +6 Battle Orders grants +125 Life instead of +50% Life

Battle Wrath is a new skill that grants the following effects (not staking) for 20 seconds:

- +125 life
- +20% Faster Run/Walk
- -20% to Enemy Defense

Overall, builds that were using CTA as their damage weapon will appreciate the change. And others, well, sorry but prebuff sucks :p

### Innocence {#innocence}

> We nerfed innocence hard since it is far too strong right now. We kept its defensive identity and a weaker blade shield. I do love proc-builds, but I'll cover how to make them work without this weird item in another section.

**Blade Cloud** : is a variant of Blade Shield (like Blade Dance for Wirlwind), providing 50-100 damage, 400% AR, but attacking slower (once per second).
