## Crafted items

Crafting should be as simple as possible while bringing as many options as possible.

### Simplification

Let people create craft infusions from crafting packs, thus making trading currencies easier.

Consider creating a chest button or Mallah interaction for "create infusions from all my currencies automatically".

The crafted item's level should be simplified, as follows:

- Characters above level 80 are always considered level 94 for crafting formulas. This prevents leveling from making crafting worse, while making crafter amulets more accessible.
- Consider removing high level affixes that make crafted items (and rare items) statistically better at lower levels than at higher levels (this doesn't really make sense).
- Help loot filters implement visual indicators for bad/decent/great crafting bases.
