## Sets

> Overall, the suggestions here will aim at balancing sets, making more of them playable later into the game, and increasing build diversity (for example by making partial sets bonuses good enough for both full sets and partial sets to be worth considering). Set items should never be great alone, though (high Guillaume's helm ^^).

### Uncommon sets

> Uncommond sets are in the ~~sweet~~ bitter spot between "I'm too low level to use them / have found all pieces" and "I now have better options". Therefore, buffing them is necessary if we want them to be played (and if we don't, then let's remove them, we don't need clutter). Imo, they should be used as not-BiS-but-still-good options, viable for mapping and mfing, but not the best option in the late game.

### Sander's Folly (Uncommon)

> The set needs a small buff with FCR and MAEK.

- Cap: **+10% Faster Cast Rate (3 items)**
- Boots: **5 Mana after each Kill (3 items)**
- Gloves: **+10% Faster Cast Rate (3 items)**

### Hwanin's Majesty (Uncommon)

> Moving bonuses from complete set to partial set bonuses.

- Hwanin's Splendor: **All Resistances +[1-33] (+0.3 per Character Level) (3 items)**
- Hwanin's Refuge: **+[1-99]% (+1 per Character Level) Damage to Demons (3 items)**
- Hwanin's Blessing: **+30% Faster Run/Walk (3 items)**
- Complete Set: **Level 13 Holy Shock aura**

### The Disciple (Uncommon)

> Moving bonuses from complete set to partial set bonuses and buffing the amulet.

- Laying of Hands: **+50% enhanced damage (3 items)** (we put the buff here since this is rlvl 63, thus preventing mld issues)
- Credendum: **+50% enhanced damage (2 items)** (same)
- Telling of Beads: ~~+1 to All Skills~~ **+2 to All Skills**
- Telling of Beads: ~~Attacker Takes Damage of [24-30]~~ **Attacker Takes Damage of [10-990] (+10 per Character Level)** (4 items)
- Set Bonuses:
  - ~~+150 Defense (2 Items)~~ --> **+[5-500] Defense (+5 per Character Level) (2 Items)**
  - ~~+150% Damage to Demons (Complete Set)~~ --> moved to 4 items set bonus
  - ~~+150% Damage to Undead (Complete Set)~~ --> moved to 4 items set bonus
  - **50% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items (Complete Set)**

### Naj's Ancient Vestige (Uncommon)

- Naj's Circlet: ~~+1 to All Skills (2 Items)~~ **+2 to All Skills (2 Items)**
- Naj's Puzzler:
  - **+1 to All Skills (2 Items)**
  - **Required level lowered to 68**
- Set Bonuses:
  - **25% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items (2 items)**
  - **25% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items (3 items)**

This gives full set a total buff of +2 to All Skills. This would make the set more appealing.

### Heaven's Brethren (Uncommon)

- ~~+2 to All Skills (Complete Set)~~ **+2 to All Skills (3 items)**

### Tal Rasha's Guardianship

> Tal Rasha is in a good spot, and with the synergy percent nerfs we're working on, it could even be BiS for some builds. I initially thought we could have the set grant Blink, but for now this would probably be OP. The reasoning was to free some points to help hybrid sorcs, but I'm afraid Nova and Frost Nova sorcs would jump (pun intended) on this opportunity.

### M'avina's Battle Hymn

> M'avina's set was adjusted to make the 4-piece bonus more accessible, encouraging set mixing and build diversity.
