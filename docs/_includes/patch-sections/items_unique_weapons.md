## Unique items

### Throwing

#### Warshrike

> Warshrike can take a buff now that the A3 mercs can't abuse it anymore.

| Current PD2                      | Zagd3m's patch                                          |

### Maces

#### Demon Limb

> Demon limb should not be a prebuff item, but an actual elite weapon.

| Current PD2                      | Zagd3m's patch                                          |

### Wands

#### Boneshade

> Unique items shouldn't be golden rare items. They need something the rares don't have. This design keeps the purpose and theme of the item without being identical to a good rare for the slot.

| Before (current PD2)                            | Zagd3m's patch                                          |
|:--|:--|

| -                                               | **25% chance to cast level 40 Teeth on casting** |
| -                                               | **25% chance to cast level 40 Bone Spirit on casting** |

### Scepters

#### Heaven's Light

> Heaven's Light should live up to its name with lightning and holy-themed effects.

| Current PD2                      | Zagd3m's patch                                          |
|:--|:--|

| -                                               | **+[3-9] Lightning Absorb** |

### Swords

#### Leoric

> CDR on Alma and Leoric is bad for build diversity, since it is both too strong and too limited in breadth.

No longer reduces Joust cooldown.

### Bows

#### Endlesshail

> Using Endlesshail for leveling or for Meme builds means facing AR/leech issues, that this Strafe buff should help alleviate.

| Current PD2 | Zagd3m's patch |
| :--|:--|
| 6% Chance to Cast Level 24 [Blizzard](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Blizzard "Blizzard") on Striking | **10% Chance to Cast Level 24 [Blizzard](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Blizzard "Blizzard") on Striking** |

| Cold Resist +35% | Cold Resist +35% |
| +40 to Mana | +40 to Mana |

#### Riphook

> RH could have a bit more identity, and be that nice merc weapon for leveling it should always have been.

| Current PD2 | Zagd3m's patch |
| :--|:--|
| - | **12% Chance to Cast Level 12 Iron Maiden on Striking** |
| +50% Increased Attack Speed | +50% Increased Attack Speed |

| +50 Open Wounds Damage per Second | +50 Open Wounds Damage per Second |
| Slows Target by 10% | Slows Target by 10% |
| +35 to Mana | **Removed** |

#### Widowmaker

> Let's make Widowmaker more relevant in the early game for Meme builds (sorcs / paladins mostly) by increasing the number of arrows fired.

| Current PD2 | Zagd3m's patch |
| :--|:--|
| Fires [Magic Arrows](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Magic_Arrow "Magic Arrow") (Level 11) | Fires [Magic Arrows](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Magic_Arrow "Magic Arrow") (Level 11) |
| +\[275-350\]% Enhanced Damage | **+\[250-320\]% Enhanced Damage** |
| Ignore Target's Defense | Ignore Target's Defense |
| 33% Deadly Strike | 33% Deadly Strike |
| +\[3-5\] to [Guided Arrow](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Guided_Arrow "Guided Arrow") | **+\[10-12\] to [Guided Arrow](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Guided_Arrow "Guided Arrow")** |
| +\[3-5\] to [Multiple Shot](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Multiple_Shot "Multiple Shot") | **+\[10-12\] to [Multiple Shot](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Multiple_Shot "Multiple Shot")** |

By buffing MS's level, we're also indirectly adding some AR, just as what the team did with Passion, and it is welcome indeed.

### Crossbows

#### Gut Siphon

> Gut Siphon is still a bit off, and hasn't really found its identity. I really like the desecrate procs (for DS builds for example), but apart from that, I'm not sure. Let's buff its strengths and reinforce its identity.

| Current PD2 | Zagd3m's patch |
| :--|:--|
| -10% to Enemy Physical Resistance | -10% to Enemy Physical Resistance |
| 12% Chance to Cast Level 28 [Desecrate](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Desecrate "Desecrate") on Striking | **24% Chance to Cast Level 28 [Desecrate](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Desecrate "Desecrate") on Striking** |
| +45% Chance to Pierce | +45% Chance to Pierce |
| +\[340-400\]% Enhanced Damage | +\[340-400\]% Enhanced Damage |
| \[6-8\]% Life Stolen per Hit | **Removed** |
| 33% Chance of Open Wounds | 33% Chance of Open Wounds |
| +1450 Open Wounds Damage per Second | **+1950 Open Wounds Damage per Second** |
| Slows Target by 10% | Slows Target by 10% |
| Drain Life -30 | **Removed** |

#### Hellrack

> Hellrack is, well, sometimes used. But never for one of its strengths: elemental damage. Let's see if, with some buffs, it becomes interesting.

| Current PD2 | Zagd3m's patch |
| :--|:--|
| -10% to Enemy Fire Resistance | -10% to Enemy Fire Resistance |
| +\[4-6\] to Fire Skills | +\[4-6\] to Fire Skills |
| +60% Increased Attack Speed | +60% Increased Attack Speed |
| +\[180-230\]% Enhanced Damage | +\[180-230\]% Enhanced Damage |
| \[100-150\]% Bonus to Attack Rating | \[100-150\]% Bonus to Attack Rating |
| Adds 63-324 Fire Damage | **Adds 99-499 Fire Damage** |
| Adds 63-324 Lightning Damage | **Adds 1-999 Lightning Damage** |
| Adds 63-324 Cold Damage | **Adds 199-299 Cold Damage** |
| Socketed \[3-5\] | Socketed \[3-5\] |

Note that those buffs are a start, maybe it will need even more buffs to become impactful enough.

#### New Unique - Pellet Bow

> There's room for a elite unique crossbow that serves as the Stone Crusher of ranged weapons. Let's see if there's room for this.

| New item |
|:--|
| -[10-15]% to Enemy Physical Resistance |
| +[300-350]% Enhanced Damage |
| -25% Target Defense |
| +20% Chance of Crushing Blow |
| +50 to Life |

The goal would be to compete with Buriza-Do Kyanon on the "raw damage" aspect, with less focus on attack speed, forcing itemization optimization.

### Class specific weapons - Assassin

#### Firelizard's Talons {#firelizard-s-talons}

[![](https://static.wikitide.net/projectdiablo2wiki/9/91/Claws.png)](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/File:Claws.png)

> The PD2 [rework](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Patch_Notes) makes Firelizard completely focussed on Fist of Fire. We aim to diversify its usecases so it can benefit several builds, including kicksins, other MAsins, and trapsins. Therefore, +fire seems more fitting than -fire (since trapsins don't benefit from it). The hard part here is to make sure this doesn't instantly outshine rare/crafted claws for trapsins or stalker for melee ones - this is a starting point that would probably need some tweaking.

| Current PD2 | Zagd3m's patch |
| :--|:--|
| +[3-4] to Fire Skills | **Removed** |
| +2 to Martial Arts (Assassin Only) | **+[2-3] to Martial Arts (Assassin Only)** |

| -15% to Enemy Fire Resistance (\[10-15\]) | **Removed** |
| Fire Resist +(\[30-50\])% | **Removed** |
| - | **Cold Resist -20%** |

#### Mage Slayer {#mage-slayer}

[![](https://static.wikitide.net/projectdiablo2wiki/6/6a/Mage_Slayer.png)](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/File:Mage_Slayer.png)

> Mage Slayer has 2 issues : slaying mages doesn't require pdr%, and it is bad. Here we try to give it an identity and a purpose throughout the game, while staying true to its name.

- **Level 16 Energy Shield When Equipped**
- ~~- +[2-247]%~~ **+[2-347]%** Enhanced Maximum Damage (~~+2.5%~~ **+3.5%** per Character Level)
- ~~Physical Damage Taken Reduced by [10-15]%~~
- ~~Adds 10-25 Damage~~
- ~~+[10-15] to Strength~~ **+[1-49] to Strength** (**+0.5** per Character Level)
- **Magic Damage Taken Reduced by [3-6]**
- **15% Damage Taken Gained as Mana when Hit**
- **25% Better Chance of Getting Magic Items**

#### Bartuc's Cut-Throat

> Small nerf to make room for other options

- +[200-~~300~~**280**]% Enhanced Damage

#### Stalker's Cull {#stalker}

> Cooldown reduction isn't healthy for the game, as it reduced items diversity for fast dflight builds. See changes to [Dragon Flight](full-notes#dragon-flight). We want it to be the Deadly Strike option amongst uniques claws, instead of being the CDR claw it used to be (hi trapsins).

- ~~Dragon Flight's Cooldown is Reduced by 0.5 Seconds~~
- [20-~~30~~**40**]% Deadly Strike

#### Shadow Killer

> Indirect buff because of the Battle Cestus changes.
