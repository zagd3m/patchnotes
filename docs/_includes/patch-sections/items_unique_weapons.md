### Wands

#### Boneshade

> Unique items shouldn't be golden rare items. They need something the rares don't have. This design keeps the purpose and theme of the item without being identical to a good rare for the slot.

### Swords

#### Leoric

> CDR on Alma and Leoric is bad for build diversity, since it is both too strong and too limited in breadth.

No longer reduces Joust cooldown.

### Class specific weapons - Assassin

#### Firelizard's Talons

[![](https://static.wikitide.net/projectdiablo2wiki/9/91/Claws.png)](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/File:Claws.png)

> The rework suggested in the [official spoiler](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Patch_Notes) makes Firelizard completely focussed on Fist of Fire. We aim to diversify its usecases so it can benefit several builds, including kicksins, other MAsins, and trapsins. Therefore, +fire seems more fitting than -fire (since trapsins don't benefit from it). The hard part here is to make sure this doesn't instantly outshine rare/crafted claws for trapsins or stalker for melee ones - this is a starting point that would probably need some tweaking.
