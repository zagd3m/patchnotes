## Other item changes

### Bad affixe pools

The following items have had their affix pool improved to be more viable as magic/rare/crafted items:

- Sorceress orbs
- Arrows and quivers (see change below)

### Magic items

> Magic items should have a chance to be good. Since they have a small number of affixes, those should have high values, like amulets where the balance between magic and rare/craft is awesome. This means buffing some magic affixes. I'll make a list eventually, on a rainy day.

### Arrows and Quivers

Arrows and Quivers are now 10 times less likely to drop. This should fix the situation where they aren't worth id-ing, and where they clutter the screen. Their affix pool has been slightly improved to compensate, by removing some trash affixes.
