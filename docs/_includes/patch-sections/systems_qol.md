## QoL

### Leveling and progression

Xp penalty from levels 15-25 have been lowered, so that players and groups who manage to get to act 3-4-5 early gain more experience there.

Xp has been increased from level 73 to level 93, to help players reach the end game faster. This is to compensate the daddy problem the community seems to be facing.

### Rushing

All characters (from the same mode and season) share their waypoint list, effectively making creating a second (and third, and...) character faster.

This should make leveling solo more appealing (good for people who play at the end of the season when there isn't much help available), without breaking the ladder start experience.

### Talk to cain / whoever

Removed mechanics where you have to talk to an NPC to access a specific portal or whatever. Implement an alternative technique that prevents rushing the game or skipping content, without having those outdated tricks in place.

### Gambling

- Increase the cost of gambled items significantly (around x10).
- Reduce the likelihood of getting a magic item, so that crafted items have more chances of being valuable.

Overall this shouldn't make crafting better or worse, simply faster since we'd skip the crap.

*Note : this would hurt gambling to craft items, but that's probably a good thing (it makes gold more valuable + it encourages using bases found from mobs).*

### Prebuffing

Prebuffing is something we fight against, because it breaks the *quality of life* and *power creep* principles.

By prebuffing we mean:

- Snapshotting, which is summoning creatures using high +skills (or +elem) gear, and then swapping to defensive or mf gear.
- Precasting buffs at higher levels.
- Precasting buffs from items that you unequip after the prebuff (hi Demon Limb).

We suggest the following approach against prebuffing:

- All summon skills have a small chance to be cast on enemy death, causing a constant renewal of the army.
- All defensive skills (Energy shield, Enchant, ...) have the same mechanic, where they are re-casted regularly.
- Items that were giving free buffs (CTA, Demon Limb, ...) have (or will) be reworked.

The goal here is to remove prebuffing entirely. Gear swapping shouldn't be an optimal strategy (or else players will do it even though it is boring). We're saving them from this [boring dilemma](gamedesign#boring-dilemmas).
