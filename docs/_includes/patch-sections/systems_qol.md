## QoL

### Leveling and progression

Xp penalty from levels 15-25 have been lowered, so that players and groups who manage to get to act 3-4-5 early gain more experience there.

Xp has been increased from level 73 to level 93, to help players reach the end game faster. This is to compensate the daddy problem the community seems to be facing.

### Rushing

All characters (from the same mode and season) share their waypoint list, effectively making creating a second (and third, and...) character faster.

This should make leveling solo more appealing (good for people who play at the end of the season when there isn't much help available), without breaking the ladder start experience.

### Talk to cain / whoever

Removed mechanics where you have to talk to an NPC to access a specific portal or whatever. Implement an alternative technique that prevents rushing the game or skipping content, without having those outdated tricks in place.

### Gambling

Increase the cost of gambled items significantly (around x10).
Reduce the likelihood of getting a magic item, so that crafted items have more chances of being valuable.
Overall this shouldn't make crafting better or worse, simply faster since we'd skip the crap.
