This page is for great ideas that have been censored since they are too bold ... and you are not ready for their wisdom.

## Remove Conviction from Infinity

Breaking immunities so fast, so easily, and so much, is a bad idea. This needs the Enigma treatment, which is: goodbye.

This probably means rebalancing Conviction from paladins to maintain a group-play vs solo-play balance.

## Remove potions from the game

Full Rajuv potions are not only making the game too easy, but also killing healing mecanisms and defensive gear. Removing them is an obvious yes.

But maybe we could go as far as removing potions. They aren't really fun to use, and they hide the real problem, which is access to healing. Basically, potions are a permanent healing mecanism, always on, as long as you bother clicking them on the ground and then pressing use. This is very strong, and also not so fun ... a clear situation we had with the famous [boring dilemma](gamedesign#boring-dilemmas).
