# Patch Notes Sections

This page provides access to individual sections of the Project Diablo 2 patch notes.

For a higher level view around the spirit of the changes I'm proposing, see the [Game Design](/patchnotes/gamedesign) section.

## Available Sections

* [Classes Changes](/patchnotes/sections/classes) - Changes to character classes and their skills
* [Items Changes](/patchnotes/sections/items) - Changes to items, including uniques, sets, and runewords
* [Systems Changes](/patchnotes/sections/systems) - Changes to game systems and general improvements

For a complete view of all changes, see the [Full Patch Notes](/patchnotes/full-notes).
