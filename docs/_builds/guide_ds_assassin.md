# Death Sentry Assassin Guide (S7)

## Intro

Hi there,

I'd like to share the build I'm playing right now (S7). Maybe you'll like it too (and also keep the claws I need, plz). Also, more builds for the wiki is always a good thing :)

**TL;DR:** this is a death sentry build that uses Death Sentry exclusively. Nothing else. Ever. (In fact, I reposition with Dragon Flight sometimes, but that's our little dirty secret, right?)

**Wait, how do you make corpses?**  
I'll answer this question. When I'm ready. To tell you. About Gut Siphon strafe A1 mercs. Oh shit. Said it.

## Project Diablo 2 Changes

### Ability Changes

Basically, less % corpse damage, more flat damage, and +% fire damage works. [More here](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Traps#Death_Sentry).

## Viability

* Can I level as this build?: Yes, I tried, it worked, but it was pretty slow compared to WoF.
* Early Ladder Viable: Yes, pretty cheap gear honestly.
* End Game Solo Viable: Yes. Clears high density maps / T3 maps with very average gear.
* End Game Group Viable: Not tested.
* Hardcore Viable: Not tested.
* Uber Trist Viable: Probably not.
* Uber Diablo Clone Viable: Probably not.

If I had to use DarkHumility's ratings, I'd probably say this is an A- build. It is very good in high-density contexts, and its dual element (physical + fire) damage is very comfortable, but you rely on the merc to create corpses, so there's a small delay to moving forward in maps. You will appreciate the very cheap itemization though - probably one of the best *bang for your bucks* you can have.

## Early Ladder Gear

Make sure your merc can kill stuff. Explode it.

## End Game Gear

### My armory if you want to see it (pretty cheap and T3 capable)

I'm not rich, but I run T3 maps. The build just works, mates. [Armory Link](https://www.projectdiablo2.com/character/ZagdemAssa)

### Weapons

* 2 claws with high +assa or +traps and +3 DS, ideally Runic Talons.
* If they have high IAS, you can even trade Treachery for something else, which might be nice, maybe.
* Honestly, there's no real alternative here imo. Even Plague is worse. So keep those claws!

### Helm

* High +skills helm, ideally with FRW
* Andy face maybe?

### Armor

* Treachery
* Alternatives: Skin of the Vipermagi / Skullder's Ire / Enigma

### Amulet

* High +traps and/or +assa amulet
* Mara's Kaleidoscope

### Rings

* Stone of Jordan (SoJ)
* Anything really

### Gloves

* I run Chance Guards :p
* Just pick anything really. Rare ones are probably BiS.

### Belt

* Arachnid Mesh is probably BiS
* Goldwrap
* Verdungo's Hearty Cord
* Rare ones are also great

### Boots

* Waterwalk
* Shadow Dancer
* Rares maybe?

### Corruptions and Charms

* Corruptions: FBR, CBF, and FHR are nice and cheap
* Charms: skillers!!!

### Mercenary

* Act 1 with Strafe (and nothing else, we really need Strafe)
* Gut Siphon (needs 8 more IAS somewhere and you're at max IAS)
* Add whatever damage reduction and leech/damage you can put so the thing survives and heals

### Whaaaat whaaat whaaat? 12% isn't enough! Not gonna work

Well, Strafe is fast. Real fast. So, yeah, it works. It just does.

## Stats and Skills

* 20 Death Sentry
* 40 in synergies
* 20 Shadow Master (you need a tank so the A1 merc can reposition and shoot)
* 2 points in Weapon Block (for those 2% FBR we need to reach 32)
* Then Fade

I suppose BoS could be an option too, but I ran Fade. Don't judge me.

## Breakpoints

* FBR: 32 (30 + 2 from Weapon Block)
* IAS: 42
* FHR: 27/48/86

## Farming Locations

Maps (you have fire + physical damage so most maps work great).

Before that, the Pit, and Chaos Sanctuary are fine, but you really need high density for this build to start shining.

## Playstyle

* Jump in with Dragon Flight.
* Cast Death Sentries.
* Wait for A1 merc to proc Desecrate and/or kill something with bolts.
* Profit.
* Repeat.

> Note: you have Wake of Inferno for bosses, even though you can very well use DS alone since your merc procs corpses.

## Feedback

Great game, mates. Thanks. I like that I can come up with stupid builds and run T3 maps with those.

Having stuff proc Desecrate is cool and honestly, it could also be other items and/or A4 mercs because it opens up interesting stuff. That said, for this build to work, no change is needed really.

Thanks. Simple as that.
