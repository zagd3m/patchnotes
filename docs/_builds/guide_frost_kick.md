## Intro

Welcome to the Frost Kick Assassin guide, a unique blend of martial arts and elemental damage. This build combines the power of Dragon Talon with the area-of-effect potential of Blade Shield, all while leveraging the Blizzard procs from Nord's Tenderizer. It's a fun but not so effective build that mixes physical damage with cold, providing good clear speed and boss-killing potential.

## Tell ChugThatEstus thank you

The idea came while playing with [https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectDiablo2/comments/uy7kcw/fissureblizzard_blades_assassin_written_guide/ Chug's] Blade Fury guide, so I thought I should thank him. BF wasn't for me, but I had fun and this would never have happened without you :)

## Project Diablo 2 Changes

### Ability Changes

* Dragon Talon now has 2 synergies and caps at 3 consecutive kicks.
* Blade Shield has been reworked to be more effective.

### Item Changes

* Nord's Tenderizer now has a chance to cast Blizzard on striking.

## Viability

* Can I level as this build?: Yes, but traps would be faster early on.
* Early Ladder Viable: Yes.
* End Game Solo Viable: Yes, you can do T1 maps reasonably fast. It isn't the best end game build ever though.
* End Game Group Viable: I think this would be trash.
* Hardcore Viable: Potentially, but requires careful play and good defensive gear.
* Uber Trist Viable: I would not try that.
* Uber Diablo Clone Viable: I would not try that.

## Feedback

Overall, I think this build works, nothing more. Its strength lies in the price : for a few wss you can clear chaos and maps because Nord and Blackoack are very cheap. It is slow, but it works, and it is safe. So. You can :)
I wanted to try it and make a guide so y'all know what to expect if you try. In case the team reads this : you can buff Nord again, it is still far from being OP :p

## Early Ladder Gear

Focus on getting Nord's Tenderizer as soon as possible. For other slots, aim for gear that provides attack rating and %pdr.

## End Game Gear

### Weapon

* Nord's Tenderizer (main weapon)
* You could try other proc weapons like Earth Shifter and Warshrike. It might work, didn't try :p

### Helmet

* Kira's Guardian (for cannot be frozen and resistances)
* Nightwing's Veil (for cold damage boost)
* Guillaume
* Gaze

### Armor

* Shaftstop (for damage reduction and life)
* Ormus' Robes (with +cold skill damage)
* Stone (for high defense)
* Leviathan (for high defense)

### Amulet

* Metalgrid (for attack rating and resistances)

### Shield

* Blackoak (for -resistances, also boosts defense quite a lot)

### Rings

* Raven Frost (for cannot be frozen and attack rating)
* Dual leech ring
* Dwarf (for block)

### Gloves

* Dracul's Grasp (for life tap proc and strength)
* Frostburn (for increased mana and cold damage)

### Belt

* Nosferatu's Coil (for deadly strike and slow target)
* String of Ears (for damage reduction)

### Boots

* Gore Rider (for deadly strike and crushing blow)
* WT (which I have not tried, but I think I should)

### Mercenary

* Act 2 Defensive Mercenary with Infinity is probably BiS (but I ran A5 might to test because this isn't a late game build :p)
* Weapon: Infinity (if you can afford it)
* Armor: Gloom is really underrated, it is a great early ladder armor

### Corruptions and Charms

* Look for corruptions that add sockets, or cannot be frozen
* Charms : max/ar or +cold damage, both work

## Stats and Skills

### Stats

* Strength: Enough for gear (could be a lot with upped boots)
* Dexterity: Enough for max block (75%, hard to reach) or to wear gear (if you don't block)
* Vitality: Everything else
* Energy: None

### Skills

* 20 Dragon Talon and synergies
* 1-5 Fade
* 20 Blade Shield and remaining points in its synergies

## Breakpoints

* FHR: 27/48/86
* IAS: 30 is enough, 50 and 95 is better but not needed

## Farming Locations

This build excels in areas with mixed monster types due to its dual damage types. Good farming locations include:

* Chaos Sanctuary
* Worldstone Keep
* Most T1 maps, especially those without cold/phys immunes

Remember to use Dragon Flight to position yourself efficiently and let your Blade Shield and Blizzard procs help clear surrounding enemies while you focus on kicking primary targets.
