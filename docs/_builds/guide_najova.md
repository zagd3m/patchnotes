order: 5

## Intro

This is a Necromancer build that uses the **full Naj's Ancient Vestige set**, focusing on Poison Nova for AoE damage and Fire Golems for tanking/immunes. It utilizes an Act 1 mercenary with **Pus Spitter** to enhance your Nova's damage output and save skill points. Indeed, with Naj + Pus you save the points on Blood Wrap and on Lower Resist, allowing for a hybrid build.

Keep in mind that this isn't a great late game build. PD2 doesn't promote hybrid builds, and Naj is still pretty bad, so you should use that until you have the HRs needed for infinity (if going fire golems) or Death Web and Bramble (if 100% nova). It is still viable (~4 to 5 minutes Chaos+Dia without Torch/anni), so you can try that.

## Project Diablo 2 Changes

### Ability Changes

- Poison Nova and Fire Golem have been adjusted in Project Diablo 2. [More details needed](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/All_Necromancer_Skills)
- Lower Resist can now be cast by Act 1 mercenaries with [Pus Spitter](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Crossbows#Pus_Spitter)

### Naj's Ancient Vestige Set

- The set has been adjusted for Project Diablo 2. [More details needed](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Exceptional#Naj's_Circlet)

## Viability

- **Can I level as this build?** Yes, but other builds might be faster.
- **Early Ladder Viable:** Yes, as the Naj's set is relatively affordable.
- **End Game Solo Viable:** Yes.
- **End Game Group Viable:** Not tested.
- **Hardcore Viable:** Not tested.
- **Uber Trist Viable:** Probably not.
- **Uber Diablo Clone Viable:** Probably not.

## Early Ladder Gear

Focus on acquiring the full Naj's Ancient Vestige set + Pus Spitter. It's relatively affordable and provides a good foundation for the build.

Keep in mind that Naj's staff is rlvl 78 so ... you need something else before that.

## Mid/End Game Gear

- Full Naj
- Trang Gloves
- Mara or +2nec/res amulet

The rest is probably going to depend on what you find, because if you can afford an Arach, then you probably should switch to an end game build (100% psn nova or 100% fire golems).

## Stats and Skills

### Stats

- Enough Strength for equipment (78 is fine)
- Rest in Vitality

### Skills

- 20 Poison Nova and synergies
- 20 Fire Golem
- 20 Golem Mastery

Skill order: 20 Poison Nova, 20 Desecrate, then level both Fire Golem and Mastery, and finally last PN synergy (dagger).

## Merc

- Vigor A1 merc (if you like to run fast)
- Strafe A1 merc (if you want more lower resist procs) ‚Üê best option

## Farming Locations

Chaos Sanctuary is my go-to location. This build excels in areas with high monster density.

## Alternatives

You could also go Skellies + Mastery instead of Fire Golems + Mastery.
You could also go Mage Skellies + Mastery instead of Fire Golems + Mastery.
Both options work. None is better than Fire golem. And anyways Revives are probably the best solution, this build was an attempt at doing something different!
