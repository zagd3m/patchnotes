## Intro

Hi there,

I'd like to share the build I've played last season. I think it was nice and old school, maybe you'll be interested. Also, more builds for the wiki is always a good thing :)

**TL;DR:** this is a kicksin build that uses Dragon Talon exclusively (no Dragon Tail fire damage nonsense, respect yourself). It is nice, safe, and uses the full Orphan's Call set. The gameplay is very relaxing. Dragon Flight on right click, Dragon Talon on the left, and you leech your way through enemies with your high defensive stats and summoned meatshield shadow. That is it!

## Project Diablo 2 Changes

**Ability Changes**

- Dragon Talon now has 2 synergies and caps at 3 consecutive kicks. [More here](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Traps#Death_Sentry).

**Orphan's Set**

- Orphan's set has gained 150% ED + 100% against demons and undead and 15@ res. It is now pretty strong and the set was already good for kicksins, so, yeah, kind of late game viable now!

## Viability

- **Can I level as this build?:** Yes, but traps is faster.
- **Early Ladder Viable:** Yes, pretty cheap gear honestly.
- **End Game Solo Viable:** Yes.
- **End Game Group Viable:** Not tested.
- **Hardcore Viable:** Not tested.
- **Uber Trist Viable:** Probably not.
- **Uber Diablo Clone Viable:** Probably not.

## Early Ladder Gear

Try and get the set asap. Without it, it might be a bit hard to do Pits, but try to go there asap for easy money. Honestly, maybe your Hell Forge will be enough to purchase the whole set and start doing Chaos runs. Mage Slayer and Stalker's Cull are pretty cheap too and do the job just well. Boots matter a lot - I'd suggest crafting some to start with until you can afford Gore Riders.

## End Game Gear

There won't be drastic changes between early gear and late game gear, though I strongly suggest switching to Astreon's for your weapon - it beats Stalker's Cull all day.

**Weapons**

- Stalker's Cull
- Astreon's (BiS)

**Armors**

- Duress
- Templar's Might
- Shaftstop (what I ran)
- Skullder's Ire

**Amulet**

- Saracen's Chance
- Atma's Scarab
- Seraph's Hymn (what I ran, very underrated imo)

**Rings**

- Bul-Kathos' Wedding Band (BK)
- Rare / crafted ones with damage and AR

**Boots**

- Gore Riders are the best imo
- I would maybe try War Traveler though

**Mercenary**

- I ran a Lacerator A5 merc and it worked well. Even with crap gear, it stays alive quite easily. Late game, I might consider going Doom / Templar though - never tried tbh.

**Corruptions and Charms**

- Pick good corruptions for your set: the items are cheap so you can roll stuff easily. Typically, I ended up having many slots, CBF, ED, etc.
- Max/AR charms are better than Skillers, though the latter give 20% ED 25% AR to DT so, not bad.
- Damage jewels are nice!

## Stats and Skills

- Aim for 75% block, enough strength for gear, and then vitality.
- 20 Dragon Talon
- 40 in synergies
- 20 Fade
- Remaining in Shadow Master

I suppose BoS could be an option too, but having that sweet 50% reduction + maxed res is sweeeeeeeeet.

## Breakpoints

- You need 50 IAS with Astreon's, or 18/46/71 for Bartuc's
- FHR: 27/48/86

## Farming Locations

Maps without physical immunes are the best. Before that, the Pit, and Chaos Sanctuary are fine.
