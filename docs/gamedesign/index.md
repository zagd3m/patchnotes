# Game Design Philosophy

This section explains the game design reasoning behind the proposed changes for Project Diablo 2.

## Guiding principles

### Official principles (I agree with them all)

I believe the claims that PD2 made when it started were great, but they weren't exactly ... accomplished. So, I'm here to push for more of it !

- Build diversity
- Quality of life
- Balance

Remember : PD2 is a "mod for and by passionate Diablo 2 fans. We aim to maintain the Lord of Destruction experience and provide consistent ladder resets while improving on the game as if development never ceased."

### I'll also add my own 3

- Noob friendlyness : I believe we can get non-d2 players to play PD2 ... if we're noob-friendly enough
- Fan service : when the whole community asks for something, something (sometimes slightly different) should be done
- Power creep : don't make the game easier with every patch, only to invent harder late game content to compensate

## Build diversity : let's actually do it

Build diversity is something everyone talks about, but few actually try to accomplish. Build diversity isn't going from 50 possible builds to 51. It is going from 50 to 50Â².

- Most skills should be worthy to be played as a main skill.
- Most builds should have several viable paths, some with defensive skills, others going glass cannon, etc...
- Most builds should have the choice between using only one skill or having several (weaker) skills.
- ...

We'll know we have build diversity when not all kicksins play Phoenix, when not all (elem builds) mercs play Infinity, etc... If there's only one reasonable option, I'll be thinking about ways to give you another option, and that's what patches should focus on imo.

## Boring dilemmas

We'll sometimes mention the "boring dilemma" concept. By that, I mean having the choice between an optimal strategy that feels boring or bad, or a suboptimal strategy that feels great. When such choices are offered to players, game designers are probably doing something wrong.

Examples of boring dilemmas:

- Precasting / prebuffing
- Gear swapping
- ...

We'll try to detect such dilemmas and fix them.
