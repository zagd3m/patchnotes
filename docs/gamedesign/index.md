# Game Design Philosophy

This section explains the game design reasoning behind the proposed changes for Project Diablo 2. 

## Foreword

### Why I made a website

I tend to spam the #feedback channel with ideas, so I made a website to collect them. Simpler, leaner, nerdier.

### Contributing to the Discussion

While these notes represent my personal view on game design, I encourage you to:

1. Think critically about the proposed changes
2. Acknowledge that I'm not a PvP player, and as a result changes will sometimes be absolutely necessary even though my ideas rock on paper

Remember that good game design often involves finding the right balance between competing goals and understanding that not every player will agree with every decision.
See you on Discord's #feedback channel.

## Guiding principles

I believe the claims that PD2 made when it started were great, but they weren't exactly ... accomplished. So, I'm here to push for more of it !

- Build diversity
- Quality of life
- Balance

Remember : PD2 is a "mod for and by passionate Diablo 2 fans. We aim to maintain the Lord of Destruction experience and provide consistent ladder resets while improving on the game as if development never ceased."

I'll also add my own:
- Noob friendlyness : I believe we can get non-d2 players to play PD2 ... if we're noob-friendly enough
- Fan service : when the whole community asks for something, sometimes it should be done
- Power creep : don't make the game easier with every patch, only to invent harder late game content to compensate

## Build diversity : the real way

Build diversity is something everyone talks about, but noone actually tries to accomplish seriously.

Build diversity isn't going from 50 possible builds to 51. It is going from 50 to 50Â².
