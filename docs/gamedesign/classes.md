# Class Design Philosophy

Welcome to the class design philosophy section. Here you'll find detailed explanations of the reasoning behind class-related changes in Project Diablo 2.

## Design Principles

When proposing class changes, the following principles are considered:

1. **Class Identity**
   - Each class should have unique strengths and weaknesses
   - Skills should feel thematically appropriate
   - Build diversity within each class is encouraged

2. **Power Scaling**
   - Skills should scale meaningfully with investment
   - Early game skills should remain relevant
   - End-game skills should feel powerful but not trivialize content

3. **Synergy and Interaction**
   - Skills should work together in interesting ways
   - Cross-class synergies should exist but not be mandatory
   - Support builds should be viable but not required
