# Item Design Philosophy

Welcome to the item design philosophy section. Here you'll find detailed explanations of the reasoning behind item-related changes in Project Diablo 2.

## Design Principles

When proposing item changes, the following principles are considered:

1. **Item Progression**

   - Clear progression path from normal to endgame
   - Multiple viable options at each tier
   - Unique items should feel special without being mandatory

2. **Build Enablement**

   - Items should enable new builds, not define them
   - Interesting trade-offs between different item choices
   - Support for diverse playstyles

3. **Item Economy**

   - Balance between item rarity and power
   - Multiple paths to item acquisition
   - Crafting as a viable alternative
