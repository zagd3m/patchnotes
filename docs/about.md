# About page

I am Zagd3m. I've been playing D2 since WW1, and before that I was serving in a pre-life bacteria research facility on mars. I said too much.

## Foreword

### Why I made a website

I tend to spam the #feedback channel with ideas, so I made a website to collect them. Simpler, leaner, nerdier.

### Contributing to the Discussion

While these notes represent my personal view on game design, I encourage you to:

1. Think critically about the proposed changes
2. Acknowledge that I'm not a PvP player, and as a result changes will sometimes be absolutely necessary even though my ideas rock on paper

Remember that good game design often involves finding the right balance between competing goals and understanding that not every player will agree with every decision.
See you on Discord's #feedback channel.
